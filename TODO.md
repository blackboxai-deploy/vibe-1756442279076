# Quantum Random Number Generator Website - Implementation Progress

## Setup & Core Structure
- [x] Create project structure and navigation
- [x] Implement root layout with navigation
- [x] Set up routing structure

## Core Cryptography & QRNG
- [x] Implement quantum-inspired random number generator
- [x] Create secure password generation algorithms
- [x] Build AES-256-GCM encryption/decryption utilities

## Pages Development
- [x] Build encryptor page with password generator
- [x] Implement message encryption functionality
- [x] Create decryptor page with input blocks
- [x] Add real-time decryption functionality

## UI/UX Enhancement
- [x] Design quantum-themed background effects
- [x] Add smooth animations and transitions
- [x] Ensure responsive design across devices

## Image Processing (AUTOMATIC)
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) â†’ AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing

## Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Install dependencies and build project
- [ ] Test encryption/decryption end-to-end
- [ ] Validate API endpoints with curl
- [ ] Start development server and get preview URL

## Current Status
Starting implementation...
